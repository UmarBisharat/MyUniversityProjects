# CarCustomization_Java
🚗 Car Showroom System (Java OOP Project)

This is my 1st-year, 2nd-semester Java OOP project.
It simulates a luxury car showroom where customers can buy new or used Mercedes models and customize them with modifications.
The system also demonstrates threads by simulating the car preparation process.

🔑 Features

Choose between new or used cars.

Available models:

🟢 E-Class

🔵 S-Class

🔴 G-Wagon


Optional modifications:

Sport, Off-road, or Classic tires

Paint (Black, White, Metallic Silver)

Sport Exhaust upgrade


Thread simulation → showroom "prepares" the car before delivery.

Final bill calculation including modifications.


📚 Concepts Practiced

Inheritance & Polymorphism (EClass, SClass, GWagon inherit from Car).

Encapsulation for modifications.

Threads (Showroom extends Thread to simulate preparation).

Switch-case & Input handling using Scanner.


🧑‍💻 Personal Note

This project was special for me because it was my first big OOP project in Java.
I felt like I was building a real car showroom simulation and learned how to use threads to make the program more realistic. 🚘⚡
Do you want me to also prepare README descriptions for all your semester projects one by one (whenever you share code), so that later you can directly copy-paste into GitHub?
