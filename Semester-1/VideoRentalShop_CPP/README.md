# VideoRentalShop_CPP
🎬 Video Rental Shop (C++ Project)

This is my Semester 1 C++ project, where I built a simple Video Rental Shop system.
It was one of my first attempts to combine structs, switch statements, and basic input/output into a real-world style program.

🔑 Features

Browse movies from three industries: Hollywood, Bollywood, Lollywood

Select a movie with details about its hero

Two transaction options:

Purchase → fixed price of $500

Issue → enter issue date and calculate due date (3 days later)

Late return penalty system → $50 per extra day

Neatly structured with struct IssueDate and separate functions


📚 Concepts Practiced

Structs (IssueDate)

Switch-case logic

Functions for modular code (displayMovies(), handleTransaction())

Basic date handling and penalty calculation


🧑‍💻 Personal Note

This project was special for me because it gave me confidence in writing longer, menu-driven C++ programs. It was the first time I felt like I was building something that simulated a real shop system.
