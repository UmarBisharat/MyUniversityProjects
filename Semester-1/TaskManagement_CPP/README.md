# TaskManagement_CPP
ðŸ—‚ Task Management System (C++)

This is my Semester-1 University Project, a console-based Task Management System written in C++.
It allows managing assignees, tasks, and checklist items with simple text-based menus.
The program also generates individual reports for each assignee with their assigned tasks and checklist status.

âœ¨ Features

âœ… Add and manage Assignees (ID, Name, Email, Phone)
âœ… Add and manage Tasks (ID, Name, Assignee, Status)
âœ… Add Checklist Items for each task
âœ… Mark checklist items as Completed / Pending
âœ… View all Assignees and Tasks
âœ… Automatically generate text-based reports for each assignee


ðŸ›  Technologies Used

C++ (core language)

File Handling (fstream) for generating reports

Vectors & Structs for data storage

Console Menu System
